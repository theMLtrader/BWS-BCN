# BWS-BCN
 Avalanche Summit Barcelona Hackathon
 
Project Overview 
The BWS ecosystem aims to democratize access to complex hedge fund options strategies and improve its users' portfolio risk-reward characteristics.
Ultimately we want to offer a similar UX of https://jonesdao.io/, but with much more sophisticated strategies underneath given the Founderâ€™s background in the last ten years in volatility trading.
We started as a proof of concept with an Entry-Level Gamified dApp ( which Design still needs a lot of work) based on the idea to position ourselves as a "cooler" https://defikingdoms.com/ to appeal to younger users first, but we will have different "front-ends" and eventually focus on the one that will maximize the protocol value.

BCN sub-project Description

BWS portfolio comparison allows users to evaluate the custom portfolio's relative value and determine if it outperforms other securities or indices, so users can gauge the performance of a group of securities and understand the calculations used to determine the results. Users can also review results with calculation transparency, such as price appreciation. To best our knowledge, this is the first tool to show a portfolio equity curve on a portfolio of Tokens + Farms + Stable in a unique wrapper for user perspective

Quick Start

Users can Start typing the name of the security / or previous optimized portfolio that they want to gauge performance for, then select it from the list that appears (e.g., BTC).
Users should enter the date range and the period of the securities' performances to track the exact return calculations they need to compare securities.
